COMMENTS:

Please add any comments that you wish to pass on to the graders or instructor.

for the creative part, i added more animations to the other spheres to be sort of like a solar system with the light source in the middle and the spheres are planets. you may have to put the light source in the middle to see everything. i also added some more myFloats to make some rotations faster.
